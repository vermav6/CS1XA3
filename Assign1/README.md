7. Size of a file as taught in class by the Instructor aswell as from stack exchange (https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/16640/how-can-i-get-the-size-of-a-file-in-a-b   ash-script)
8. Shift command as from http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_09_07.html, as it was not removing argument in the beginning of the list.
